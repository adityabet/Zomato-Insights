## üíæ Sample Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Analytics

* **Top 10 cities with the most customers**

```sql
SELECT CITY, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY CITY
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

* **Recent signups in last 30 days**

WHERE signup_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Restaurant Insights

FROM restaurants
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

* **Restaurants by cuisine type**

SELECT cuisine, COUNT(*) AS total_restaurants
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY cuisine
ORDER BY total_restaurants DESC;
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Menu & Orders

* **Most ordered menu items**

```sql
SELECT mi.item_name, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM order_details od
JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.item_id
GROUP BY mi.item_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

* **Total revenue per restaurant**

```sql
SELECT r.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Delivery Analytics

* **Top 5 delivery partners by average rating**

```sql
SELECT name, rating
FROM delivery_partners
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

* **Average delivery time per restaurant**

```sql
SELECT r.name, AVG(TIME_TO_SEC(delivery_time)/60) AS avg_delivery_minutes
FROM deliveries d
JOIN orders o ON d.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY avg_delivery_minutes ASC;
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Feedback

* **Top-rated restaurants by customers**

```sql
SELECT r.name, AVG(rt.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM ratings rt
JOIN restaurants r ON rt.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

* **Orders with ratings below 3**

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.name AS customer, r.name AS restaurant, rt.rating
FROM ratings rt
JOIN orders o ON rt.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
WHERE rt.rating < 3;
```

If you want, I can also **create a ready-made PPT slide content** with emojis and screenshots for each query to directly use in your presentation.

Do you want me to do that next?
